# react-table-list-hook-form

This is a working example that demonstrates how to build a form utilizing a list of a custom type, using the following packages: `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `shadcn/ui`, and `zustand` for state management and data persistence to local storage.

If working with a list of hundreds or thousands of rows check out: [Working with virtualized lists](https://www.react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage/)
